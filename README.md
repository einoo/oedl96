Optimal experimental design on adaptive observation experiments

## Motivation

This repository shows the story of the adaptive observation experiments by 40-variable Lorenz-96 model: 
$$\frac{dx_i}{dt}=(x_{i+1}-x_{i-2})x_{i-1} - x_i + F,$$ 
where $F$ is the forcing and the variable $x_i$ is taken to be periodic: $x_{i+n} = x_{i}$.
In this study, we set $n=40$ and $F=8$.  The
nodes numbered from 1 to 20 lie over the ocean, and those from 21 to 40 lie over
the land (Fig. 1).

All land sites receive observations very 6 hours; while there are no routine observations all over the ocean. 
The objective of this study is to find one adpative observation all over the ocean.
